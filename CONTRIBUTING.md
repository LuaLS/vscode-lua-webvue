## Pull Requests
To add your own changes to this project, fork this project and check out the [development section of the README](./README.md#development). It will detail how to get set up for development and testing.

Once you have your changes in your own repo, you can open a [pull request](https://github.com/LuaLS/vscode-lua-webvue/pulls) to request that your changes be added to this repository. Here are some tips for making a great pull request:

- Make sure you review and test your changes first so that your pull request isn't rejected due to a small oversight or syntax error.
- If you are solving an issue, make sure you [link your PR to it](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Make sure the "Allow edits by maintainers" checkbox is checked. This will allow maintainers tweak some things.
